JavaScript is as scripting language critical to the function of the modern internet.

By virtue of being a scripting language, JS is not compiled, nor run in the traditional
Sense, but is interpreted and run in a browser environment. JavaScript serves to allow users to interact
With web pages beyond the static limits of HTML.

JavaScript is an Object Oriented language, meaning the structure of
Functions and operations is built around referencing objects and their 
Methods, in a similar manner to Java.
